### Reporting Issues
If you find a typo, broken link, or unclear instruction in the website:
1.  Check the [Issues](https://github.com/terminal-index/vfio-windows-aio/issues) tab to see if it has already been reported.

### Suggesting Enhancements
I love suggestions for new topics, clearer explanations, or design/layout improvements!
1.  Open an issue and describe your suggestion.
2.  Explain why this enhancement would be useful to other users.

### Pull Requests
Ready to make a change? If you're damn sure, follow these steps:

3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

    *   Test your changes by opening `index.html` in your browser.
5.  **Commit your changes** with a nice message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "fix: corrected typo in prerequisites"
    ```
6.  **Push to your fork**:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request** against the `gh-pages` branch of the original repository.

## 🎨 Style Guide

*   **HTML:** Use semantic HTML5 elements where possible. Keep indentation consistent (4 spaces).
*   **CSS:** Use CSS variables (defined in `/`) for colors and common values. Keep the design clean and consistent with the existing theme.
*   **JavaScript:** Keep scripts lightweight and vanilla JS (no external frameworks (thank god) unless discussed).

It's all MIT, so do whatever you want :)
